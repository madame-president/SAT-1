# Problems that SAT addresses:

### Time related:

1. Automatically provides the fiat value of the transaction.
2. Automates the process of copy/paste data from block explorers by exporting all data directly into Excel.

### Accuracy & Fair-value related:

3. Valuations of current balances and historical transactions are done at the time of transaction, and not based on the opening/closing price.

### UTXO model to double-entry related:

4. The direction of the transaction is provided, meaning each transaction is clearly shown as "sent or received".

### Reproducibility related:

5. A common, shared standard that can be easily reproduced by anyone.
